# SM Adaptive Math Quiz (Netlify, React, Serverless)

Deployable out-of-the-box. For AI-generated questions, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Netlify.

## Quick start (Netlify)
1) Create new site from this repo/zip.
2) Set Environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your key.
3) Deploy. Functions live at `netlify/functions`.

If you skip step (2), the app still works using a local fallback item generator.
